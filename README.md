Hello Professor Li!

This is the initial documentation in order to run the code for LiFit,
the customizable and interactive web application for your daily workout routine.

The code is structured in a way that requests user input as an initial argument.
After you input the weight and reps that you are capable of, the application will calculate your workout.

You will then be brought to Week 1. Each of the four weeks contains four individual workouts suited for your
capabilities based off the initial weights that you have inputted.

As the weeks continue, the workout will become increasing more difficult in order to maximize your effort
and achieve the results while conducting the workout.

This file contains individual workouts for four weeks. After the four weeks, you have completed the program.

Under the Wendler's workout program which we have decided to implement into this application, you will continue
to build up the weight until week four, at which point is a recovery week for the user, as the weight required
will decrease.

We hope that you enjoy the application. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Team LiFit,
Alex Beshansky, Chris Maddox and Jerry Lee
